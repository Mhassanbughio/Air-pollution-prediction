# Air pollution prediction

# Project overview
This project focuses on leveraging machine learning to predict air pollutant concentrations across diverse in different regions . By integrating historical data and employing advanced modeling techniques, the aim is to create a predictive framework capable of providing accurate estimations of pollutant levels. This research endeavors to offer a proactive tool for environmental management, policy formulation, and public health enhancement.

# Introduction:
Air pollution poses a significant challenge in different regions, impacting both human health and the environment. This research seeks to address this issue by developing a machine learning-based predictive model to estimate air pollutant concentrations. The goal is to utilize historical data on air quality indices, meteorological parameters, and geographical features to build a robust predictive framework capable of forecasting pollutant levels in specific regions.

# Problem Statement:
As we know Air pollution even in pakistan poses a serious threat to public health and the environment, causing health issues and harming nature. The challenge is to accurately predict how much pollution might be in the air in different parts of the country. Current methods often lack precision, making it tough to plan and take action to keep the air clean. This project aims to use computers and past data to create a better way to predict air pollution. The goal is to build a system that can forecast pollution levels accurately, helping authorities make smarter decisions to protect people's health and the environment.
